# n8n-nodes-lexoffice-api

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use _app/service name_ in your n8n workflows.

Its purpose is to provide access to the [Lexoffice Public API](https://developers.lexoffice.io/docs) through a single node.

Additionally, a trigger node to reacto the [Lexoffice Events](https://developers.lexoffice.io/docs/#event-subscriptions-endpoint-event-types) is provided as well.

_App/service name_ is _one or two sentences describing the service this node integrates with_.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Operations

Refert to the [Lexoffice Public API](https://developers.lexoffice.io/docs) documentation for available operations.

Note that not all operations may be supported by the node yet (and some may simply not work... please open an issue in that case!)

## Credentials

Access to the API requires an [API-Key](https://developers.lexoffice.io/cookbooks/public-api/#api-key) from Lexoffice.

You can generate one [here](https://app.lexoffice.de/addons/public-api) if your account supports it.
